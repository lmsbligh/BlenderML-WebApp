=====================



This is the documentation for the Flask server. Each route is saved in its own file and ran as a Flask Blueprint. 
The configuration for the server is stored in conf.py.

Routes
------

Models
~~~~~~

The endpoints in `models` allow users to create, retrieve, update, and delete neural network models. These include routes for managing model architecture, 
and retrieving activation types, layer types, as well as checkpoint listings for existing models.

Datasets
~~~~~~~~

The endpoints in `datasets` allow users to create, retrieve, update and delete dataset profiles, as well as retrieving a subset of images from the dataset.
