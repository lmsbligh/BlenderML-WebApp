## Current Medium Term Goals

- [ ] Experiment with the model:
	- [ ] Different architectures
	- [ ] Other activations
- [ ] Increase diversity of training data:
	- [ ] different object orientations
	- [ ] different objects
	- [ ] different background images


## Longer Term Goals

- [ ] Increase models number of material properties:
	- [ ] Include more principled BSDF properties
	- [ ] Include other node types
- [ ] Allow model to 
	- [ ] experiment with different node trees/orientations? Establish if this makes sense from a graphics/Blender perspective
	- [ ] model particles, other graphical utilities to achieve different visual effects
- [ ] Build a pipeline to allow:
	- [ ] Multiple object selection/detection
	- [ ] Generate material/object properties from this
	- [ ] Generate material/object from photos
