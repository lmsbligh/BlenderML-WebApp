Anxiety around ones ability to recall short and long term memories can effect the ability to do so.

Things you can do to help:
- **Mindfulness** and **relaxation**
- **Positive reinforcement**: Acknowledge success in recalling information, regardless of how small or simple the recall was. Even small wins will help build up confidence and reduce the anxiety loop.
- **Self compassion:** Negative self talk can worsen anxiety. Remember that everyone struggles with memory from time to time; your concerns are valid but manageable.
- **Reframe expectations:** Remind yourself that others perceptions aren't necessarily reflections of your abilities. Approach each situation as an opportunity to surprise yourself.
- **Set boundaries** on negative self talk, especially surrounding your memory.
