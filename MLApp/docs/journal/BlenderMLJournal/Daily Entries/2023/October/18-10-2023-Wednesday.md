## Rough Aims


## What I did

Worked on adding functionality to save renders to a date-time stamped directory. Blender script is calling an error, see jupyter In 11. Added a utils module which will contain various functions that may be useful throughout the project.

Worked on random world background functionality. Need to fix the .blend file and make a backup.
