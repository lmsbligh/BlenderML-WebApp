- [ ] in jupyter/prototype:
- [x] Create functionality to: for a given set, predict parameters 
- [x] render those predictions  
- [x] display predictions side by side with test data (images).
- [ ] improve usability, ie asking whether to overwrite pre-existing renders/params or write alongside etc
- [ ] implement these in the project
- [ ] document
- [ ] commit to git

## Rough Aims


## What I did

Worked on functionality to write predictions to JSON file and to load and render data from predictions in Blender. Added functionality to display test data and predictions side by side. See Jupyter.
## Conclusion, Notes of Importance and Plans

Need to transfer jupyter code to the project in a reusable manner and document.
