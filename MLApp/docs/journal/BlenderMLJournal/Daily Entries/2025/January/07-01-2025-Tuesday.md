I have been really bad at updating this journal lately. I have now roughly completed the front end; at least in terms of implementing all of the UI elements required.
## Rough Aims

I now have to connect the front end to the backend, in order to do this I need to do some planning, specifically:
 - What datasets/profiles need to be persistently stored on the backend and how to do so.
	 - Assess how often these should be fetched/updated from the front end.
 - Determine which scripts the back end needs to be able to run, eg scripts for running Blender, PyTorch tasks etc.
 - Implement API to send/fetch images from server.
## What I did

Sent all data from the server rather than being hardcoded into the web app; it's now hardcoded in the server. Next step will be to implement some kind of write to file, perhaps a database.
