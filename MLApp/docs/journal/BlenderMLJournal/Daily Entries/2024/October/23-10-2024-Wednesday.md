## Rough Aims

Try to assess the status of this project. Produce some rough plan of action.
## What I did

Because of lack of documentation.. It took me quite some time to re-establish the following:

To start the backend:
```
flask-server\venv\Scripts\activate && python flask-server\server.py
```
And then the frontend:
```
cd client && npm start
```
## Conclusion, Notes of Importance and Plans

- Use this journal more.
- Document even the simple things.
