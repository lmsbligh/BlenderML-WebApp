## Rough Aims

- [ ] Mock-up basic wireframe UI
- [ ] Create static UI in React
- [ ] Determine functionality/state residence
- [ ] Implement functionality
## What I did

I fixed an issue where the data loading asynchronously was leading to the app trying to run .map on a variable that had no data. Decided I'm going to scrap state entirely at this point and just implement purely placeholder UI. The state I was implementing was only using placeholder data anyway and it's just causing a headache. It's not being efficiently handled and I need to sit down and figure this out in one go as opposed to try to build the UI and the state/backend functionality simultaneously.
