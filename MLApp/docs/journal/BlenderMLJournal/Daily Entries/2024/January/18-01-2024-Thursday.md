## Rough Aims

Assess how to add multiple skybox images, random object orientation, scale and model shape.

Write rough plan of how to implement these.

## What I did

### Skybox

Wrote code to load images into blender from a directory: 

```python
    image_node = output_node.inputs["Color"].links[0].from_node
    skybox_list = os.listdir(os.path.join(blend_file_directory, "Backgrounds"))
    #new_image_path = f"Backgrounds/{skybox_list[2]}"
    #image_file_path = 
    for img in skybox_list:
        img_path = os.path.join(blend_file_directory, "Backgrounds", img)
        bpy.data.images.load(img_path)
    image_node.image = bpy.data.images[3]
```
