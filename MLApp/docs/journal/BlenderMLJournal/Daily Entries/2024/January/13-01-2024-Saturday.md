## Rough Aims

- [ ] Establish where I left off and create a new task list..
## What I did
I have apparently been working on a better structure for parameter/render storage, it appears to now be more useable so I will leave it as is for now. May rewrite it completely in the future.
Experimented with adding Skyboxes via code; 

```python
world = bpy.context.scene.world
output_node = world.node_tree.nodes["Background"]

if output_node.inputs["Color"].is_linked:
    
    image_node = output_node.inputs["Color"].links[0].from_node

    new_image_path = "Backgrounds/studio.exr"
    image_node.image = bpy.data.images.load(image_file_path)
else:
    print("No background image found in the world.")
```
